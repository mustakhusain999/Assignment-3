# Factorial Calculator (Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This Python program calculates the factorial of an integer using recursion.  
It also handles invalid inputs like floating-point numbers and negative numbers.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Program Explanation

1. The program asks the user to input a number.
2. If the input contains a decimal point `"."`, it prints an error message:
   > *"Factorial does not exist for float numbers."*
3. If the number is an integer:
   - **Negative integers** â†’ Output: *"Factorial does not exist for negative numbers."*
   - **0 or 1** â†’ Factorial is **1**
   - **Positive integers** â†’ Factorial is calculated recursively.

# Math Module Calculations (Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This Python program demonstrates how to use the **math module** for performing basic mathematical operations on a given number.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Program Explanation

1. The user is asked to enter a number (float allowed).
2. The program uses the **math** module to calculate:
   - **Square Root**
   - **Natural Logarithm (base e)**
   - **Sine value** (in radians)
3. The results are displayed to the user.
